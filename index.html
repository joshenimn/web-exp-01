            <p>little bottle in her hand which had a picture of a cat on it and it was written on it, ‘Catsy The Cat Meow Meow’.

While going, she thought that where would she go? Catsy didn’t know the way to Milky’s house. She thought, “Who is the one who knows the way to Milky’s house?”

Catsy remembered that there is a knowledgeable owl in the city who knows everything. Now Catsy will first go to the Gyan Owl’s house.

Catsy swung the car and moved towards Gyan Owl’s house. After reaching the owl’s house, she started loudly ringing the horn of the car, ‘Pe Pe Pe Poooooo.’

The owl came out from inside and said, “Don’t shout! Don’t shout! I am coming”

“It’s me, Catsy your sweet cat meow meow,” said Catsy.

“Oh my dear Catsy, you came here after a long time. What’s the matter?” The Gyan owl said.

Catsy asks, “I don’t know the way to Milky Cow’s house. Can you tell me the way?”

The owl said, “Oh wow! You are going to Milky’s house. You are so good I have to give some stuff to Milky.”

Then the owl asked, “Will you give these kinds of stuff to the Milky?”

Catsy said, “Yes, I will definitely. Put all the stuff behind the car.”

After picking up the luggage the owl told Catsy the way to Milky’s house. Catsy then turned on her car and moved towards Milky’s house.</p>
<p>The first time she opened her big mouth and barked, the awful noise shook the walls of the palace and frightened the king and all his courtiers. If the dog had stopped with one or two barks, the matter might have been forgotten.But again and again her fierce roaring shook the palace and the Earth itself. Before long there was no resting between barks. Nobody in the palace could hear themselves talk. The king was desperate and sent for the hunter.He asked, "Why does your dog make such a deafening noise?""The dog is hungry," said the hunter"Nothing that is easy for you to give," said the hunter. "Your Majesty, there are people in this kingdom who are eating all the food and who are not sharing it with those who do the work in the field to make the food grow. As a result, there are people who are always hungry. This dog feels the hunger of every person in this kingdom who does not have enough food to eat. As long as even one person is hungry, this dog will be hungry and he will keep barking."On hearing the hunter say this, the king was even more frightened than ever. It had never entered his thoughts that he had been doing anything wrong. He had thought that the people of his kingdom were simply supposed to always do exactly what he wanted. It had never occurred to him that a king should think of the happiness of anyone except himself.He was now angry from his head to his feet, inside and outside. Either he would go mad hearing the continuous barking of that enormous dog, or else something would have to be done and that very quickly. So he called his wise advisors together and said: "What shall I do?"The wise ones bowed their heads and walked off to think over the question together. (Leader — You may wish to pause here, and ask the children what the king should do.) But try as hard as they could, the advisors could see only two possible solutions. Either the enormous dog must be killed, or else every hungry person in the kingdom must be fed. No one was willing to kill the dog. So thatmeant there was only one thing left to do. Everybody in the kingdom must somehow be fed. The wise advisors were very clear in their minds about it. They returned to the king and told him plainly what had to be done. They had to shout, of course, because the enormous dog was still barking. The king hesitated no longer</p>
